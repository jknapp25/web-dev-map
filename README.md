# web-dev-overview
The goal is to create a high-level overview poster of web development in 2018. Like looking out of a plain at a city below.

Why?
As a beginning software developer, you don't know what you don't know. And that basic understanding that you don't know, will keep you from being able to create something of value.

Qualities:
- Fun
- Funny
- Fantastical
- Comprehensive (breaking from my f's)
- High-level
- Visual
- Big ole thing
- Clear
