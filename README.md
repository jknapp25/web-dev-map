# web-dev-overview
The goal is to create a high-level overview poster of web development in 2018. Like looking out of a plain at a city below.

## Why?

As a beginning software developer, you don't know what you don't know. And that basic understanding that you don't know, will keep you from being able to create something of value.

Let's help newer developers get their berrings in the complicated world of web development with a map of the web ecosystem.

## What?

A massive poster, like 70"x50" or something like that. Something you can stick on your wall and stand in front of for an hour. Something people can hand out at conferences or gift you if you say you're starting to learn. A work of art that you're proud of having up.

Qualities:
- Fun
- Funny
- Fantastical
- Comprehensive (breaking from my f's)
- High-level
- Visual
- Big ole thing
- Clear

## How?

Well, me right now. Anyone's welcome!
